# 🌍 World Wide Energy Consumption Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **worldwide energy consumption and emissions** using **SQL**. The goal is to understand how energy is produced, consumed, and how it impacts global CO₂ emissions across different countries and years.

The analysis helps identify:

* Top countries by GDP
* Global emission trends over time
* Emission contribution by different energy types
* Relationship between GDP growth and emissions

This project is created as part of my learning and practical experience in **SQL and data analysis**.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project

* Analyze global energy consumption patterns
* Identify which energy types contribute most to emissions
* Find top countries by GDP
* Study emission changes over the years
* Derive meaningful business insights from SQL queries

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

This repository includes the following:

* README.md which explains the project, objectives, and insights
* SQL scripts used for data analysis and queries
* PowerPoint presentation showing analysis, charts, and results
* ER diagram representing database design and relationships
* A summary of key insights and conclusions derived from the analysis

---

## 🧩 ER Diagram Explanation

The database consists of tables related to:

* Countries
* Energy types
* GDP
* Emissions
* Year-wise consumption data

These tables are connected using **primary and foreign keys** to perform joins and aggregations for analysis.

You can find the ER Diagram Here: https://github.com/Yogi14-93/Project---World-Wide-Energy-Consumption-Analysis---SQL-/blob/main/EER%20Diagram.png

## ❓ Key Analysis Questions

* Which are the **top 5 countries by GDP** in the most recent year?
* How have **global emissions changed year by year**?
* Which **energy type contributes most to emissions**?
* What is the **global share (%) of emissions by country**?
* How do **GDP and emissions trend together over time**?

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* China is the **top country by GDP**, followed by the USA, India, Japan, and Germany
* Global emissions have **steadily increased from 2020 to 2023**
* **CO₂ emissions** form the largest portion of total emissions
* China contributes **over 32%** of global emissions
* GDP is rising faster than emissions, showing **better energy efficiency** in some regions

> **Note:** `These insights are derived from my own observations based on the available data and analysis. Other insights and interpretations can also be drawn from the same dataset.`

## ✅ Conclusion

* Global energy usage and emissions are increasing every year
* Fossil fuels are still the dominant energy source
* Renewable energy adoption is necessary to reduce emissions
* China, the USA, and India are key focus countries for emission control
